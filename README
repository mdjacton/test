Hi Guys.

Go to your webroot dir, for example /var/www/ and type

$ git clone https://github.com/mdjacton/test.git

change directory to "webroot"/test/app

$ mkdir tmp

change permissions on the tmp/ dir

$ sudo chmod -R 777 tmp

change dir to webroot/test

this is where you will find rims.sql, a dump of the database.

create a database in mysql called rims.

I used the following to import the database

$ mysql -u"username" -p rims < rims.sql

you will need to change the PASSWORD in "webroot"/test/app/Config/datbase.php

class DATABASE_CONFIG {

	public $default = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'YOUR PASSWORD HERE',
		'database' => 'rims',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);

Then you should be able to browse to localhost/test/users/login

Administrastor name = Martin
Password            = magic10

I left out the email section, as I was not able to set it up on my machine which made testing it a little difficult, and I left out the KM's as they seemed to warrant more time than I felt I had available, but to give you some idea as to what I would like to have done with it : 

add start and end km readings to the bookings table that would update the car table. A report on who used what km's for each vehicle.

Please let me know if I can be of further help

Kind Regards
Martin
